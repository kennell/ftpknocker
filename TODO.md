TODO
----

  * ~~use netaddr instead of iptools~~
  * allow reading host list from a file
  * ~~check if port is open using low-level socket before connecting~~
  * ~~add verbose mode~~
  * ~~add option for shuffeling the target list to avoid IDS alerts~~
  * ~~improve threading, create a fixed number of threads and give each thread list with the workload OR use eventlet module (however, this is not python3 compatible)~~
  * refactor function and variable names to something more understandable
